# Cab-Booking-System
Mid Term Project

# Objective 
In this repository we are trying to combine historical usage pattern along with the open data sources like weather data to forecast cab booking demand in a city. 

# Dataset
We are provided with hourly renting data span of two years. Data is randomly divided into train and test set. WE need to predict the total count of cabs booked in each hour covered by the testset, using the information available prior to the booking period.
**Description of the data**
* datetime-hourly date +timestamp 
* season-spring, summer, autumn, winter
* holiday-whether the day is considered a holiday
* workingday-whether the day is neither a weekend nor holiday
* weather-Clear , Cloudy,  Light Rain, Heavy 
* temp-temperature in Celsius
* atemp-"feels like" temperature in Celsius
* humidity-relative humidity
* windspeed-wind speed
* Total_booking-number of total booking

# What are we trying to achieve?
* Visualize data using different visualizations to generate interesting insights.
* Outlier Analysis
* Missing value analysis
* Visualizing Total_booking Vs other features to generate insights
* Correlation Analysis
* Feature Engineering
* Grid search
* Regression Analysis
* Ensemble Model
